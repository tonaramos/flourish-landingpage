The Bank sponsors these Services, and we operate at the Bank&rsquo;s direction and subject to its oversight and supervision. The Bank has authorized these Terms and, where so stated expressly, has agreed to be bound by them. For our compliance purposes and in order to provide the Services to you, you hereby authorize us to, directly or through a third-party, obtain, verify, and record information and documentation that helps us verify your identity and External Account information. When you register for the Services and from time to time thereafter, we may require you to provide and/or confirm information and documentation that will allow us to identify you, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li class="text text-blue text-justify">A copy of your government-issued photo ID, such as a passport or driver&rsquo;s license; </li>

                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">The purpose of the Services is to try to help you save. You select the amount you want to transfer and/or recurring amount to save from your External Account. You may choose to periodically transfer such funds from your External Account to your Flourish Account(s) via ACH. Only funds from your External Account may be transferred to your Flourish Account(s). The funds in your Flourish Account(s) are held at FDIC-insured Banks for your benefit. Our Services also encourage users to participate in savings-related activities, by offering promotions and sweepstakes that incentivize certain savings activities. Your funds will remain in your Flourish Account(s) until you instruct us to transfer any or all of your funds from your Flourish Account(s) to your External Account by logging into your Flourish Account(s) on the App, or by emailing us. We will generally transfer the requested funds from your Flourish Account(s) to your External Account within two business days of when we receive your request. It is important to know the amount of available funds in your Flourish Account(s) before instructing us to transfer funds from your Flourish Account(s). If you do not have sufficient available funds in your Flourish Account(s) to cover the amount of the requested transfer, your request for the transfer will be declined. We may also transfer funds from your Flourish Account(s) to your External Account without notice to you upon the closure of your Flourish Account(s) and at any time if required by applicable law or if we, in our sole discretion, suspect the Services are being used for illicit purposes or otherwise in violation of these Terms. You may not use the funds in your Flourish Account(s) to make purchases, withdraw cash, or for any other purpose outside of those available through Flourish&rsquo;s Application. You are solely responsible for determining whether the funds debited from your External Account and the funds maintained in your Flourish Account(s) are acceptable to you. We are not responsible for any third-party fees that may be incurred as a result of using the Services, including, but not limited to, third-party fees incurred as a result of maintaining insufficient funds in your External Account.</p>
