                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>PROMOTION DESCRIPTION:</strong> The Flourish Weekly Raffle Sweepstakes (the "<strong>Promotion</strong>") begins on April 1, 2019 at 11:00:00 p.m. Pacific Time ("<strong>PT</strong>") and ends on July 31, 2019 at 10:59:59 p.m. PT (the "<strong>Promotion Period</strong>"). The Promotion consists of independent weekly sweepstakes (each a "<strong>Weekly</strong> <strong>Sweepstakes</strong>") beginning at 11:00:00 p.m. PT on Tuesday and ending at 10:59:59 p.m. PT on the following Tuesday of each week during the Promotion Period (each a "<strong>Weekly Sweepstakes Period</strong>"). One (1) winner of each Weekly Sweepstakes will randomly be selected at the end of each Weekly Sweepstakes Period, as set forth below. Entries in one Weekly Sweepstakes will not be included in any other Weekly Sweepstakes. Entry in the Promotion does not constitute entry into any other promotion, contest, or sweepstakes. By participating in the Promotion, each entrant unconditionally accepts and agrees to comply with and abide by these Official Rules and the decisions of Flourish Savings, Inc., 2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704 ("<strong>Sponsor</strong>"), which shall be final and binding in all respects. This Promotion is in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with Apple Inc. or Google, Inc.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>ELIGIBILITY:</strong> Open only to legal U.S. residents of the fifty (50) United States and the District of Columbia who are eighteen (18) years old or older as of time of entry.

                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">Mail In To enter without linking a Flourish account to a savings account or saving on Sponsor's platform, mail a 3x5 notecard to the Flourish Weekly Sweepstakes c/o Flourish Savings, Inc., 2150 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA 94704. For each card that is received, you will receive one hundred (100) coins in your account on the Flourish app which can be used to enter the applicable Weekly Sweepstakes as detailed above. On the card, in legible handwritten print should be the following information: phone number, date of birth, and email address. Entries received in envelopes will be considered ineligible. Cards with machine printed information will not be considered eligible. Cards with postage due will not be considered eligible. If any piece of information is considered indecipherable, the entry will not be considered. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>Limit thirty (30) entries per person per Weekly Sweepstakes regardless of method of entry.</strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>GENERAL CONDITIONS OF ENTRY: </strong>Sponsor is the official timekeeper for the Promotion. All entry information and materials become the property of Sponsor and will not be acknowledged or returned. Proof of entering entry information is not considered proof of delivery to or receipt by Sponsor of an entry. Except as otherwise contemplated in these Official Rules, and to the extent entrants may otherwise elect at the time of entry, personal information collected in connection with the Sweepstakes will be used in accordance with the online privacy policy available at  <a class="text text-blue" href="https://www.flourishsavings.com/privacy-policy">https://www.flourishsavings.com/privacy-policy</a>. Any communication or information transmitted to Sponsor by e-mail or otherwise is and will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">Entry must be made by the entrant only in the manner described above. Entries made by any other individual or any entity, and/or originating at any other website or e-mail address, including but not limited to commercial sweepstakes subscription notification and/or entering service websites, will be declared invalid and disqualified for this Promotion. Tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Promotion, including but not limited to the use of any device to automate the entry process, is prohibited and any entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole discretion, to have been submitted in this manner will be void. In the event a dispute regarding the identity of the individual who actually submitted an entry cannot be resolved to Sponsor's satisfaction, the affected entry will be deemed ineligible. The Promotion Entities shall not be responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information whether caused by Internet users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Promotion or by any technical or human error which may occur in the processing of the entries in the Promotion. The Promotion Entities assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission, interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized access to, or alteration of entries.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:</strong> At the end of each Weekly Sweepstakes Period, Sponsor (or its designee) will conduct a random drawing from all eligible entries received during that particular Weekly Sweepstakes Period to select one (1) winner of that Weekly Sweepstakes. Attempts to notify potential winners will be made by email using the information entered at entry or in the entrant's Flourish profile. Sponsor shall have no liability for any winner notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by a potential winner for any reason. If, despite reasonable efforts, a potential prize winner does not respond within five (5) days of the first notification attempt, or if a prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or undeliverable to such potential prize winner, such potential prize winner will forfeit the applicable prize and an alternate prize winner may be selected. If any potential prize winner is found to be ineligible, or if he or she has not complied with these Official Rules or declines the applicable prize for any reason prior to award, such potential prize winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected. Sponsor may successively attempt to contact up to two (2) potential prize winners in accordance with such procedure, and if there is still no confirmed prize winner after such attempts have been made, if any, the applicable prize may go unawarded. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>PRIZES/ODDS:</strong> Each Weekly Sweepstakes winner will receive twenty-five dollars ($25). Flourish account holders will receive the funds by direct deposit into their linked savings account. Actual odds of winning each Weekly Sweepstakes depend on the number of eligible entries received during the applicable Weekly Sweepstakes Period. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>GENERAL PRIZE CONDITIONS:</strong> No cash alternative or substitution of prizes will be allowed, except Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute prizes of comparable value if any prize listed is unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason. Prizes will be awarded only if the potential prize winner fully complies with these Official Rules. All portions of the prize(s) are non-assignable and non-transferable. Any prizes pictured in point-of-sale, online, television and print advertising, promotional packaging, and other Promotion materials are for illustrative purposes only. All details and other restrictions of the prize(s) not specified in these Official Rules will be determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. <strong>Each prize winner shall be solely responsible for all federal, state and/or local taxes, and the reporting consequences thereof, and for any other fees or costs associated with the applicable prize.</strong> The potential prize winner may be required to execute an Affidavit of Eligibility, a Liability Release, and (where imposing such condition is legal) a Publicity Release (collectively, "<strong>Prize Claim Documents</strong>). If any potential winner fails or refuses to sign and return all Prize Claim Documents within five (5) days of prize notification, the winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>GENERAL LIABILITY RELEASE/FORCE MAJEURE:</strong> Entry in the Promotion constitutes entrant's permission, for the Promotion Entities to use the entrant's name, photograph, likeness, voice, biographical information, statements and address (city and state) for advertising and/or publicity purposes worldwide and in all forms of media now known or hereafter developed, in perpetuity, without further compensation.

Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual who is found to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Promotion, to be acting in violation of these Official Rules, or to be acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner, or with the intent to disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion, or to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, and Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. No mechanically reproduced, illegible, incomplete, forged, software-generated, or other automated multiple entries will be accepted. Sponsor reserves the right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the Promotion if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Promotion is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical problems, failures, or malfunctions or other causes beyond Sponsor's control have destroyed or severely undermined or to any degree impaired the integrity, administration, security, proper play, and/or feasibility of the Promotion as contemplated herein. In the event an insufficient number of eligible entries are received and/or Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or continuing with the Promotion as contemplated herein by any event beyond its control, including but not limited to fire, flood, natural or man-made epidemic of health or other means, earthquake, explosion, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, satellite or equipment failure, riot or civil disturbance, terrorist threat or activity, war (declared or undeclared), or any federal state or local government law, order, or regulation, public health crisis, order of any court or jurisdiction, or other cause not reasonably within Sponsor's control (each a "<strong>Force Majeure</strong>" event or occurrence), then subject to any governmental approval which may be required, Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, extend, or terminate the Promotion. If the Promotion is terminated before the designated end date, Sponsor will (if possible) select the winner in a random drawing from all eligible, non-suspect entries received as of the date of the event giving rise to the termination. Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant's sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances. Only the type and quantity of prizes described in these Official Rules will be awarded. These Official Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a written document issued in accordance with law by a duly authorized representative of Sponsor.

Unless otherwise stated in these Official Rules, in the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Official Rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.</p>
