                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">(c) you are not a U.S. resident of at least 18 years of age (or older if you reside in a state where the majority age is older);</p>

                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">Flourish may change the Terms from time to time at its sole discretion by posting a notice of the change on the Website and Mobile Application ("App"), provided that if Flourish makes any changes that materially alter the terms by which the Services are provided, Flourish will also notify you by sending you an email to the last e-mail address you provided. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to any change after receiving a notice of such change, you shall stop using the Services and terminate this Agreement as described below. Otherwise, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the changes. Please regularly check the Website or App to view the then-current Terms.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">The Services enable you to earn non-monetary credits/tokens ("Flourish Coins") when you perform certain activities related to your personal finances (e.g. depositing money into the savings accounts you have connected to or opened through your Flourish Account, setting up a goal, inviting friends, logging into the app or completing your profile).</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>User Account </strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">You must register for a user account ("Account") to access the Services. When you create an Account, you will be asked to select a unique username and create a password. We may require you to submit certain additional information to complete your registration. You represent and warrant that:</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">(a) all registration information you submit is truthful and accurate,</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">(b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information, and</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">(c) your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and password, and are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your username. You agree (i) not to allow any third party to use your Account, username or password at any time and (ii) to notify Flourish promptly of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Account, username or password, or any other breach or suspected breach of these Terms. Flourish reserves the right to terminate your username and password if there are clear suspicions of unauthorized third party activity.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">We offer you the ability to open and maintain two different types of accounts at Flourish (each a "Flourish Account"). One option is to register in the Flourish app by connecting an existing savings account ("read only" account type). The other option is to open a FBO account as part of the onboarding process through the Flourish app ("FBO Flourish account") </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">When you set up your profile via the Services, you will need to link at least one external financial account ("External Account") to your profile in order set up a Flourish Account. You represent and warrant that you have the right to control any External Account you sign into via the Services. The integration service enabling you to sign into an External Account via the Services is provided by our third party API providers (the "Integrators".) You authorize the Integrators, pursuant to your instructions, to access your External Account to perform the transactions you request within the Flourish App. If during the course of linking your External Account your profile is flagged for review by our compliance systems, you may be asked to upload documentation supporting your identity. You agree only to upload documentation that is current, accurate, and belongs to you. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">You will be able to make six free withdrawals from your Flourish Account to your External Account monthly and unlimited additional withdrawals subject to a service fee. We may impose a $5.00 service fee for any withdrawal over the six free withdrawal limit. In addition, if we notice a pattern of deposits and withdrawals that we determine to be suspect, or not in the nature of building savings over time, we reserve the right to suspend access to the Services and to your funds in the Flourish Account until an investigation into your account activity can be completed and to terminate your use of the Services. Deposits into your Flourish Account may take up to 3-5 business days to process. During that time the funds will be unavailable for withdrawal or other use. You may obtain information about the balance of funds in your Flourish Account(s) at any time by logging in to your Flourish Account(s) on the Application.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">If you decide to open a FBO Flourish Account the following additional terms will apply to your use of the Services, <b><a class="text-blue text text-link" href="https://www.flourishsavings.com/fbo-terms-of-service"> https://www.flourishsavings.com/fbo-terms-of-service </a></p>

                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>Referral Program</strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">From time to time Flourish may run a user referral programs, allowing current users to invite potential users to Flourish. If a current user decides to participate in a referral program he or she understands and agrees that each referred user provided to Flourish must be a bona fide user who has not had a Flourish account within the last 180 days. A bona fide user must have a unique name, email address, phone number and a unique valid bank account, as determined in our records and cannot be referred to Flourish through any automated mechanism. Flourish reserves the right to distribute referral bonuses only upon a referred bona fide customer establishing their Flourish account and linking a unique valid bank account to their Flourish account. Flourish also reserves the right to investigate any suspicious or inappropriate activity relating to a referral and is not obligated to distribute any referral bonus if we determine, in our sole discretion, that a referral (i) was not made by and/or for a bona fide customer, or (ii) that the referring customer engaged in fraudulent or deceitful behavior in making a referral, including through automated means. Referral bonuses generally will be credited within three (3) weeks of the referral, but if we suspect a violation of these terms, we can delay distribution of a referral bonus for a longer period while we investigate the matter more carefully. If in our sole discretion we determine that a referral is not bona fide or the referring customer engaged in fraudulent or deceitful behavior, Flourish reserves the right to not distribute a bonus, or freeze the bonus in offending-customer&rsquo;s Flourish Account pending verification that such referral was by or for a bona fide customer.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">Flourish reserves the right to close any Account for violation of terms. Flourish reserve the right to terminate or change a referral program without notice; referral bonuses will be based on the then-current program in effect when a referred user successfully opens an Account. Neither a referring nor a referred user shall be deemed to have any economic or legal interest in a referral bonus until such referral bonus has been distributed to them by Flourish in accordance with these terms.</p>

                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>Termination</strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">These Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Flourish as set forth below (the "Term"). We may terminate these Terms at any time for any reason or no reason in accordance with the Rules by sending you an email to the address of record in your Account. In addition, these Terms of Service will automatically terminate upon any breach of these Terms by you. You may terminate these Terms at any time by (a) notifying Flourish at any time by sending an email to info@FlourishSavings.com with the subject "Termination of Terms of Service" and (b) closing your Account for the Services. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you shall promptly discontinue use of the Website and the Services and your Account and right to access and use the Services and Website will terminate immediately, including access to your User Content and the permanent forfeiture of any earned coins, plays or any other credits or awards. However, Sections of User Content, IP Ownership, Feedback, Warranty Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Termination, and General Provisions of these Terms will survive any termination of the Terms. You agree that we will have no liability to you for any costs, expenses, losses, damages, or liabilities arising from or relating to such termination.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">You agree to indemnify and hold harmless our company and its affiliates from and against any and all claims, costs, proceedings, demands, losses, damages, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and legal costs) of any kind or nature, arising from or relating to, any actual or alleged breach of these Terms by you or anyone using your account. If we assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with us in such defense.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>Arbitration Agreement &amp; Waiver of Certain Rights</strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong></strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">You and Flourish agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and Flourish hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Flourish relating to these Terms or the Offerings (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Rules"). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Flourish will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Flourish from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Flourish also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and Flourish retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">Neither you nor Flourish may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Flourish&rsquo;s individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with Flourish.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR FLOURISH WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify"><strong>General Provisions</strong></p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">Under no circumstances will we be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">These Terms and your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to conflict or choice of law rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any other jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">You agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms, the Site, or Services will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California. You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions. </p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">The failure by us to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision in the future.</p>
                        <p class="text text-blue text-justify">We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets or equity, or by operation of law.</p>
